## Benchmarks and comparisons of STEF with other formats

This module holds benchmarks that compare STEF against other 
formats. It also generates charts for the public docs.

## Quick start

- Run benchmark suite: `make benchmark`.
- Run `make update-charts` to refresh graphs used in `docs/benchmarks.html`.
